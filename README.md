# eventStaking
A practice blockchain project for portfolio.

A program that lets people pay a small amount, RSVP for an event, and if they don’t show up then everyone who did shares in the reward.
A person can create and event, and check people in. If someone RSVPs but doesn't get checked in they lose their staked ETH.
